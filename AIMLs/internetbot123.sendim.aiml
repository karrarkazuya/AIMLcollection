 <template><u>How To Build a Robot</u><br>Robots can serve many useful purposes around your house, and they're very easy to build. First, find an old <star1> that you may have <star2> around the house. Then get some wires and some <star3> parts so that your robot can stand on its own. Then grab a 5 2/3-inch <star4> and start welding the parts together. Make sure you connect all the wires safely or you could give yourself a <star5> shock. After you've connected the wires together <star6>, encase all of the electric parts of the robot with some <star7>. This is to ensure that your robot won't break down if it gets <star8> with water. Now just turn on the <star9> and your robot will be able to do whatever you program it to.<settopic=hello></template>
