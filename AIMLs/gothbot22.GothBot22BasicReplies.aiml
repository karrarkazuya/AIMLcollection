<li>Seems a guy was driving for hours through desolate country when he passed a farmhouse, and before he could react, a cat ran out in front of him and *splat!*... he flattened the cat.<br><br>Out of kindness and consideration, he stopped, turned around and drove back to the farmhouse to notify the occupants.  When the housewife came to the door, said he, &quot;Pardon me, ma'am, but I just ran over a cat in front of your house, and assumed that it must belong to you. I know this might be hard to hear, but I wanted to let you know instead of just driving off....&quot;<br><br>&quot;Not so fast,&quot; said she. &quot;How do you know it was our cat?  Could you describe him? What does he look like?&quot;<br><br>The man promptly flopped down on the ground, and said, &quot;He looks like this!&quot; as he gave his best shot at a dead cat impression.<br><br>&quot;Oh no, you <i>horrible</i> man,&quot; she replied.  &quot;I meant, what did he look like *before* you hit him?&quot;<br><br>The man got up, covered his eyes with both hands and screamed, &quot;Agggghhhhhhhhhh!&quot;
<li>A rookie police officer was out for his first ride in a cruiser with an experienced partner. A call came in telling them to disperse some people who were loitering.<br><br>The officers drove to the street and observed a small crowd standing on a corner.<br><br>The rookie rolled down his window and said, &quot;Let's get off the corner people.&quot;<br>A few glances, but no one moved, so he barked again:<br>&quot;I SAID, let's get off that corner... NOW!&quot;<br><br>Intimidated, the group of people began to leave, casting puzzled stares in his direction.<br><br>Proud of his first official act, the young policeman turned to his partner and asked, &quot;Well, how did I do?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Pretty good,&quot; chuckled the vet, &quot;especially since this is a bus stop!&quot;
<li>A lady is throwing a party for her granddaughter, and had gone all out: a caterer, band, and a hired clown. Just before the party started, two bums showed up looking for a handout. Feeling sorry for the bums, the woman told them that she would give them a meal if they will help chop some wood for her.  Gratefully, they headed to the rear of the house.<br><br>The guests arrived, and all was going well with the children having a wonderful time. But the clown hadn't shown up. After a half an hour, the clown finally called to report that he was stuck in traffic, and would probably not make the party at all.<br><br>The woman was very disappointed and unsuccessfully tried to entertain the children herself. She happened to look out the window and saw one of the bums doing cartwheels across the lawn. She watched in awe as he swung from tree branches, did midair flips, and leaped high in the air.<br><br>She spoke to the other bum and said, &quot;What your friend is doing is absolutely marvelous. I have never seen such a thing. Do you think your friend would consider repeating this performance for the children at the party? I would pay him $50!&quot;<br><br>The other bum says, &quot;Well, I dunno. Let me ask him:  HEY WILLIE! FOR $50, WOULD YOU CHOP OFF ANOTHER TOE?&quot;
<li>A man joins a big corporate empire as a trainee.<br>On his very first day of work, he dials the pantry and shouts into the phone, &quot;Get me a coffee, quickly!&quot;<br><br>The voice from the other side responded, &quot;You fool, you've dialed the wrong extension! Do you know who you're talking to, dumbass?&quot;<br><br>&quot;No,&quot; replied the trainee.<br>&quot;I'm the CEO of the company, you fool!&quot;<br><br>The trainee shouts back, &quot;And do YOU know who YOU are talking to, you fool?!&quot;<br>&quot;No,&quot; replied the CEO indignantly.<br><br>&quot;Good!&quot; replied the trainee, and he put down the phone.
<li>This man goes along to the Patent Office with some of his new designs.  He says to the clerk, &quot;I'd like to register my new invention. It's a folding bottle.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Okay,&quot; says the clerk. &quot;What do you call it?&quot;<br><br>&quot;A fottle,&quot; replies the inventor.<br><br>&quot;A fottle? That's stupid! Can't you think of something else?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I can think about it. I've got something else though. It's a folding carton.&quot;<br><br>&quot;And what do you call that?&quot; asks the clerk.<br><br>&quot;A farton,&quot; replies the inventor.<br><br>&quot;That's rude. You can't possibly call it that!&quot;<br><br>&quot;In that case,&quot; says the inventor...<br><br>&quot;You're really going to hate the name of my folding bucket.&quot;
